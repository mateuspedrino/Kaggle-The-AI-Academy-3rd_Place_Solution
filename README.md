# Kaggle-The-AI-Academy-3rd_Place_Solution
This repository contains the notebooks that my team (curiosos_do_ml) used in the DOJO ML Kaggle competition hosted by The AI Academy. Competition link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dojoml-saocarlos.

Notebooks:
- prepare_data : this notebook was used to manage and process all the .csv data available in the competition and come up with a final training and test single .csv;
- exploratory_analysis : some baby exploratory analysis just to understand a bit of the data dynamics;
- models : train and tune several models and pickle them;
- trained_classifiers : use the trained and tuned pickled models.
